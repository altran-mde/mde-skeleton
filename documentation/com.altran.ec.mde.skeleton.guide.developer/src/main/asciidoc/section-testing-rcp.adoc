== Testing RCP

RCP Testing Tool (RCPTT) is a project for GUI testing automation of Eclipse-based applications. 
RCPTT is fully aware about Eclipse Platform's internals, hiding this complexity from end users and allowing QA engineers to create highly reliable UI tests at great pace.

TIP: For detailed information on using RCPTT, see https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/

Because RCPTT provides development tools that need to be installed in Eclipse, the Oomph setup file needs to be updated.

NOTE: This step can be skipped when the MDE skeleton Oomph setup file is used as a base, as described in section <<create-oomph-setup-file>>, because RCPTT is already included.

To add the RCPTT development tools, open the Oomph setup file in Eclipse and perform the following steps:
 
. Expand the `P2 Director (Project Specific Development)` node +

. Add a new `Requirement` for the RCPTT platform feature.

Now RCPTT can be used. 
First create a new test project using the `RCP Testing Tool Project` wizard. 
After that the `Test Case` wizard can be used to add test cases.
Now the test case can be recorded using the `Record` button.
A popup will be shown to select the Application Under Test (AUT).
Here your Eclipse product must be selected.

TIP: Create a link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-97.htm[resource filter] for the `target` folder on your test project to avoid duplication errors when building with Maven.

The MDE skeleton already provides a RCPTT project that can be used for reference: link:{giturl}/tests/com.altran.ec.mde.skeleton.xtext.refactoring.move.tests[com.altran.ec.mde.skeleton.xtext.refactoring.move.tests^].
Simply run its test cases by right-clicking the project and select menu:Run As[Test Cases] from the context menu.
Then select `Eclipse RCPTT AUT` as Application Under Test and click btn:[OK].
The link:{giturl}/tests/com.altran.ec.mde.skeleton.xtext.refactoring.move.tests/pom.xml[Maven pom ^] in the project shows how to configure RCPTT in Maven, for more information please read the https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/maven/[RCPTT user guide^].
