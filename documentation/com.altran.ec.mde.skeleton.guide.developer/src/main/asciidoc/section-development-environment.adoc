[[git-directory-structure]]
=== Initial Git directory structure

[[git-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

As described in the previous section we tend to use the <<git-workflow>> branching model.
In this model the central repo holds https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#the-main-branches[two main branches] with an infinite lifetime: 

- `master`
- `develop`

IMPORTANT: Before creating an initial directory structure, please make sure that these branches are available in the remote repository and configured correctly, i.e., both protected and `develop` marked as the default branch.

[[git-bootstrap]]
==== Bootstrapping a git repository

When the <<git-prerequisites, prerequisites>> are met, you can start with bootstrapping the repository with its initial content.
The EMF Reference Project provides a script that provisions the repository with the correct directory structure and content to build an empty Eclipse RCP application that can be used for further development.
The bootstrapped application will contain a developer documentation plugin that provides the instructions on <<setup-development-environment, setting up a development environment>>.

The listing below shows how to use the EMF Reference Project bootstrap script.
In this example, the https://gitlab.acidspace.nl/cge-coe-mde/larch[LArch] repository is used as an example and the callouts below the listing explain the steps in more detail.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

----
<1> Clone the empty ACIDSpace git repository that will be bootstrapped.
    It is assumed that the `develop` branch is set as default branch of the repository.
    In this example, the repository is cloned into a sub-directory called `larch`.
<2> Clone the MDE skeleton repository to download the bootstrap script.
    The tag, i.e., `-b BOOTSTRAP-2020-06`, specifies the version of Eclipse that is used for the RCP.
    For a list of available versions, please see the https://gitlab.acidspace.nl/cge-coe-mde/mde-skeleton/-/tags?sort=updated_desc&search=BOOTSTRAP[available tags].
    The repository is cloned into a sub-directory called `mde-skeleton`.
<3> Running the `bootstrap.sh` copies all required data to the target repository and adapts it for your project.
    The script takes 3 parameters: +
+
. The name of the product
. The prefix that will be used. 
  This should be unique for your product.
. The directory where the target repository is cloned, see step 1.
<4> When the script is done, a commit has been created such that it can be pushed.
    When the commit is pushed, the product is built automatically in ACIDSpace and both the README of the repository and its Gitlab pages will contain information on how to setup an Eclipse development environment.
    The output of the script provides pointers on how to manually build your product on your local system from the command line, please read section <<setup-maven>> before running a command line build.

The directory structure of the target repository will look like:

[[git-directories]]

[[create-oomph-setup-file]]
=== How to create an Oomph setup file

This section describes the typical steps to take for creating an Oomph setup file for a project in the ACIDSpace environment.
An Oomph setup file enables the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Eclipse Installer] to automate the installation of Eclipse development environments.
For more generic information on (authoring) Oomph, please read the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Authoring[Eclipse Oomph Authoring Wiki]

IMPORTANT: If you have used the <<git-bootstrap, bootstrap.sh>> script when creating your repository, the `releng/eclipse` directory will already contain a setup file and a lot of the steps below will already have been performed.
It is still wise to review the generated setup file using the steps below.

The easiest way to create an Oomph setup file is to either use the <<git-bootstrap, bootstrap.sh>> script (for a new git repository) or download the link:{giturl}/{oomph-setup-file-path}[setup file of this {project-name}^] and use it as a base.
The downloaded setup file should be renamed to `__<project_name>__ACIDSpace.setup` and it is recommended to save it in the `releng/eclipse` directory in your git repository, also see the <<git-directories>>.
After opening the setup file in Eclipse, the model tree looks like:

image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-overview.png[]

Please perform the following steps to tailor the setup file for your project:

TIP: If the Properties view is not yet visible, open it using the context menu on one of the tree nodes menu:Show Properties View[]

. Select the `MDE Assets - MDE Skeleton` node and modify its properties in the Properties View
.. `Name`: `acidspace.__<gitlab_project_name>__`
.. `Label`: `__<project_name>__`
.. `Description`: `__<project_description>__`

. Modify the `Value` property of `gitlab.acidspace.nl.project` to the relative path of your project in ACIDSpace GitLab.

. Modify the `Value` property of `oomph.setup.file.path` to `releng/eclipse/__<project_name>__ACIDSpace.setup`.

. The last two tree nodes specify the streams (i.e. branches) for which a development environment can be set up.
  All nodes in the tree can also be moved within a stream node allowing different configurations per stream.
  Typically the `master` and `develop` streams are defined, allowing customizations in the development environment on the develop branch without impacting the master release branch. +
  Please note that developing on another branch (e.g. a feature branch) is supported, just <<setup-checkout-branch>>.

. Expand the `P2 Director (EMF Development)` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-p2-general.png[]
.. The common requirements for EMF development are contained in this subtree.
   The last node specifies the ACIDSpace proxy location for the required Eclipse version.
   Please review the Eclipse version and adapt the url if applicable.

. Expand the `P2 Director (Project Specific Development)` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-p2-project.png[]
.. The {project-name} adds e.g. Xtext and Sirius as additional requirements.
   Please add all requirements for the development environment for your project to this section.
   Optionally you can also add additional repositories that provide your required artifacts. +
+
TIP: Opening the `Repository Explorer` view by means of the context menu menu:Explore[] on a repository node, allows you to easily drag and drop your requirements in the tree.

. Expand the `Source Code` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-source-code.png[]
.. Most items are preconfigured and do not need attention bu if your project does not support Maven and Tycho, please disable the `Maven and Tycho` node by means of its context menu menu:Disabled[]

. Expand the `Target Platform` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-target-platform.png[]
.. We support two ways for <<eclipse-target-platform>>.
   Please read the section and enable the node for the chosen solution.
.. If you choose to use a `Modular Target Platform`, please update the `location` of the `TargetDefinitionGenerator` to the correct location in your git repository.
   The content of the target platform can be authored within the sub tree of the `Modular Target Platform` node.

TIP: Whenever the Oomph setup file is modified, an Eclipse Oomph refresh is required to apply the changes to the current workspace, use the menu menu:Help[Perform Setup Tasks...] image:{imgdir}/update_gear.png[].

[[setup-maven]]
==== Build code with Maven

Please perform the steps in this section if you want to build your code using Maven on your local system.
The code can built using Maven from either the command line or from within Eclipse, please read the "**Use**" items of https://maven.apache.org/index.html[the Maven documentation^] before running Maven the first time.

In ACIDSpace's CI/CD the credentials of a project are stored in the `TECHNICAL_USER` and `TECHNICAL_PASSWORD` environment variables.
In order to be able to use the Maven `settings.xml` both in CI/CD and on your local system, you should also set these environment variables on your local system.

CAUTION: It is strongly advised to store an encrypted password in the `TECHNICAL_PASSWORD` environment variable for security reasons.
Maven supports server password encryption, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[].

The `releng/eclipse` directory contains pre-configured Eclipse launch targets to build your code using Maven from within Eclipse.

The root Maven `pom.xml` for the {project-name} project is located in the root of the local git repository.
Just open a command line at that location and type the following command to build the code:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean verify -s settings.xml
----

[[setup-checkout-branch]]
==== Checkout another branch

Typically you will develop your feature in a feature branch.
To start working on a feature, start by creating an issue in GitLab.
From the issue, a feature branch can be created using the GitLab web UI.
Make sure to prefix you branch name with `feature/`.

When the feature branch is created, you can continue with fetching the new branch in your Eclipse development environment, see link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Tasks.html#Fetching_from_upstream[Fetching from upstream].
Then continue by switching to the new branch, see link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Tasks.html#Checking_out_an_existing_Branch[Checking out an existing Branch]

TIP: Whenever you switch to an existing branch, it is strongly advised to  perform an Eclipse Oomph refresh by using the menu menu:Help[Perform Setup Tasks...] image:{imgdir}/update_gear.png[].
This ensures that your development environment is reconfigured to match the requirements for that branch.
