=== How to create an Oomph setup file

This section describes the typical steps to take for creating an Oomph setup file for a project in the ACIDSpace environment.
An Oomph setup file enables the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Eclipse Installer] to automate the installation of Eclipse development environments.
For more generic information on (authoring) Oomph, please read the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Authoring[Eclipse Oomph Authoring Wiki]

The easiest way to create an Oomph setup file is to download the link:{giturl}/{oomph-setup-file-path}[setup file of this {project-name}^] and use it as a base.
The downloaded setup file should be renamed to `__<project_name>__ACIDSpace.setup` and it is recommended to save it in the `releng/eclipse` directory in your git repository, also see <<git-directory-structure>>.
After opening the setup file in Eclipse, the model tree looks like:

image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-overview.png[]

Please perform the following steps to tailor the setup file for your project:

TIP: If the Properties view is not yet visible, open it using the context menu on one of the tree nodes menu:Show Properties View[]

. Select the `MDE Assets - MDE Skeleton` node and modify its properties in the Properties View
.. `Name`: `acidspace.__<gitlab_project_name>__`
.. `Label`: `__<project_name>__`
.. `Description`: `__<project_description>__`

. Modify the `Value` property of `gitlab.acidspace.nl.project` to the relative path of your project in ACIDSpace GitLab.

. Modify the `Value` property of `oomph.setup.file.path` to `releng/eclipse/__<project_name>__ACIDSpace.setup`.

. The last two tree nodes specify the streams (i.e. branches) for which a development environment can be set up.
  All nodes in the tree can also be moved within a stream node allowing different configurations per stream.
  Typically the `master` and `develop` streams are defined, allowing customizations in the development environment on the develop branch without impacting the master release branch. +
  Please note that developing on another branch (e.g. a feature branch) is supported, just <<setup-checkout-branch>>.

. Expand the `P2 Director (EMF Development)` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-p2-general.png[]
.. The common requirements for EMF development are contained in this subtree.
   The last node specifies the ACIDSpace proxy location for the required Eclipse version.
   Please review the Eclipse version and adapt the url if applicable.

. Expand the `P2 Director (Project Specific Development)` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-p2-project.png[]
.. Currently the {project-name} only adds Xtext as an additional requirement.
   Please add all requirements for the development environment for your project to this section.
   Optionally you can also add additional repositories that provide your required artifacts. +
+
TIP: Opening the `Repository Explorer` view by means of the context menu menu:Explore[] on a repository node, allows you to easily drag and drop your requirements in the tree.

. Expand the `Source Code` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-source-code.png[]
.. Most items are preconfigured and do not need attention bu if your project does not support Maven and Tycho, please disable the `Maven and Tycho` node by means of its context menu menu:Disabled[]

. Expand the `Target Platform` node +
+
image::{imgdir}/oomph-setup-tree-target-platform.png[]
.. We support two ways for <<eclipse-target-platform>>.
   Please read the section and enable the node for the chosen solution.
.. If you choose to use a `Modular Target Platform`, please update the `location` of the `TargetDefinitionGenerator` to the correct location in your git repository.
   The content of the target platform can be authored within the sub tree of the `Modular Target Platform` node.

=== How to setup a development environment

To start developing for {project-name}, please perform the following steps:

. Start with downloading the `Eclipse Installer` from: +
  https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer
. Start the `Eclipse Installer`
. Select the `advanced mode` +
+
image::http://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/Contributor_Guide/images/Oomph-01-advanced-mode.png[]
. On the https://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/html/user/wizard/DocProductPage.html[Product Page] 
.. Select `Eclipse Platform`
.. Product Version: `{eclipse-version}`
.. Click btn:[Next >]
. On the https://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/html/user/wizard/DocProjectPage.html[Projects Page]
.. (_One time only_) Click the image:http://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/images/trees/DULKrP4IGs7HGSVqoXcwRFgPxZQ=.png[] icon to add the {project-name} project.
... Catalog: `Eclipse Projects`
... Resource URIs: `link:https://gitlab.acidspace.nl/{gitproject}/-/raw/{gitbranch}/{oomph-setup-file-path}?oomph_form=b%27users/sign_in%27#/[]`
... Click btn:[OK] +
+
NOTE: Though using the Resource URI above is preferred, it is known that for some users the URI didn't work and they got an error: _The URI ... does not contain a valid product_.
In this case the setup file can also be link:https://gitlab.acidspace.nl/{gitproject}/-/raw/{gitbranch}/{oomph-setup-file-path}?inline=false[downloaded] and added by clicking btn:[Browse File System...].
... Enter your GitLab credentials when asked for
.. Select `{project-name}` in the tree
.. Select stream `{gitbranch}` in the table
.. Click btn:[Next >]
. On the https://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/html/user/wizard/DocVariablePage.html[Variables Page]
.. Review all variables values, especially the `Installation folder name` and `Root install folder`
.. Click btn:[Next >]
. On the https://help.eclipse.org/{eclipse-version}/topic/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/html/user/wizard/DocConfirmationPage.html[Confirmation Page]
.. Click btn:[Finish]

Your development environment will now be prepared.
Please accept all licenses and certificates and provide your GitLab credentials when asked for.

[[setup-maven]]
==== Build code with Maven

Please perform the steps in this section if you want to build your code using Maven on your local system.
In ACIDSpace CI/CD an MDE project is typically built using Maven, but this can also be done locally.
In ACIDSpace's CI/CD the credentials of a project are stored in the `TECHNICAL_USER` and `TECHNICAL_PASSWORD` environment variables.
In order to be able to use the Maven `settings.xml` both in CI/CD and on your local system, you should also set these environment variables on your local system.

CAUTION: It is strongly advised to store an encrypted password in the `TECHNICAL_PASSWORD` environment variable for security reasons.
Maven supports server password encryption, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[].

The `releng/eclipse` directory contains pre-configured Eclipse launch targets to build your code using Maven from within Eclipse.

[[setup-checkout-branch]]
==== Checkout another branch

Typically you will develop your feature in a feature branch.
To start working on a feature, start by creating an issue in GitLab.
From the issue, a feature branch can be created using the GitLab web UI.
Make sure to prefix you branch name with `feature/`.

When the feature branch is created, you can continue with fetching the new branch in your Eclipse development environment, see link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Tasks.html#Fetching_from_upstream[Fetching from upstream].
Then continue by switching to the new branch, see link:{eclipse-help-location}/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Tasks.html#Checking_out_an_existing_Branch[Checking out an existing Branch]
